        <h5 class="serif uppercase">"Diversity Honors" makes a huge splash to celebrate leaders who have made a significant impact in LGBT activism in honor of Harvey Milk</h5>
        <p>The inaugural Diversity Honors, co-presented by the Harvey Milk Foundation and The Pride Center at Equality Park and hosted by the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood, Florida on Saturday, May 9 raised more than $50,000 and recognized national and South Florida leaders who have made a significant impact on improving the quality of life for the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) community.</p>
        <p>This milestone event paid tribute to Judy and Dennis Shepard, LGBT civil rights activists and co-founders of the Matthew Shepard Foundation, who received the Harvey Milk Honors Medal award from Stuart Milk, nephew of the late civil rights icon, Harvey Milk (1930-1978).

Two unannounced lifetime achievement awards were presented to columnist and publisher Norm Kent and iconic cabaret performer Joey Arias.</p>
        <p>The impressive evening of recognition with 350 guests included a festive cocktail reception, headline entertainment by Joey Arias, plus a gravity-defying performance by Cirque Dreams and the national anthem by Casandra Ortiz.</p>
