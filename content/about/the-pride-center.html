Support, social and educational groups focus on women, seniors, youth, men, transgender individuals, recovery, health, the arts, athletics, spirituality, games and more.  More than 35,000 adults and youth attend activities at The Center each year.  Outreach activities over the past year directly impacted 250,000 residents and visitors to South Florida. The Pride Center recently broke ground on campus for The Residences at Equality Park, their affordable and supportive housing community for Seniors living with disabilities.
