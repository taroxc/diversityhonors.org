            <i>"We provide a welcoming, safe space--an inclusive home--that celebrates, nurtures and empowers the LGBTQ communities and our friends and neighbors in South Florida."</i>
        </p>
        <p>The Pride Center will celebrate 30 years of service this June 25, 2023. We serve a beautifully diverse community.  More than 35,000 adults and youth attend activities at The Center annually. We host more than 65 regularly-meeting groups each month. Support, social and educational groups focus on seniors, people living with HIV/AIDS, people of transgender experience, communities of color, recovery, women, young adults, men, health, the arts, athletics, spirituality, games and more. Outreach activities directly impact over 250,000 residents and visitors to South Florida.</p>
        <p>A paramount goal for The Pride Center is to reduce HIV transmission in our community and increase access to treatment within our communities. Though we are not a traditional AIDS Service Organization, The Center has served as a vital site for HIV testing, prevention, linkage, support, outreach and education. For the past 14+ years, our comprehensive prevention initiatives have a proven, effective legacy of reducing HIV transmission and improving the quality of life and health outcomes for those impacted by the epidemic. The Center is equally committed to ensuring that all persons living with HIV in Broward County are linked to, and retained in, HIV care, thereby contributing to lowering the community viral load.</p>
        <p>The Equality Park campus offers five-and-a-half acres of property with 30,000 square feet of office space that provides homes for programs and services, as well as synergy among various other organizations who are housed here. The life-enhancing, innovative programs we provide each day have been used as best practice models for centers worldwide--in HIV prevention, Seniors programming, women's health resources, outreach to communities of color and more. We take pride in that work.</p>
