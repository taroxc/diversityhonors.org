        <p>The third annual Diversity Honors presented by Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino at Hard Rock Live was a huge success drawing over 500 guests to benefit the Harvey Milk Foundation and The Pride Center at Equality Park. The global event raised more than $80,000 to be split between the two organizations.</p>
        <p>Ireland Senator Dr. David Norris was awarded with the Harvey Milk Foundation’s Lilla Watson Global Leadership Award and Pulse nightclub massacre survivor Isaiah Henderson received the Harvey Milk Foundation’s Milan Rozsa Award. Several other South Florida and international leaders were honored, including legendary entertainer Tiffany Arieagus, community leader Ilene Berliner, Palm Beach County Human Rights Council Treasurer Dan Hall, Board President and Interim Executive Director of Miami Theater Center Giselle Kovac, transgender advocate Jessica Norton, CEO of Stoli Group USA Patrick Piana, CEO of Compass in West Palm Beach Tony Plakas and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.</p>
        <p>Critically acclaimed singing string quartet Well-Strung headlined the gala, which featured a lively cocktail reception, silent auction, seated three-course dinner and inspiring awards presentation hosted by WSVN-TV’s Craig Stevens.</p>
        <p>The evening concluded with a bang at the Stoli After-Party, also at Hard Rock Live, with entertainment from illusionist TP Lords and recording artist Kym Sims. After-party attendees danced the night away with an open bar, engaging robots and live music spun by world-renowned DJ Tracy Young in the club-like atmosphere.</p>
