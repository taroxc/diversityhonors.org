            <p>For the last ten years, Romas Zabarauskas has been making provocative, genre-bending films underpinned by queer characters. Romas is interested in subverting the paradigm of “positive portrayal” of queerness. His heroes are never model citizens nor victims they are humans. They fight, take drugs, question their identity, riot, fail, get involved in murders, redeem themselves and do all the passionate and tender things people do in movies.</p>
            <p>Romas promotes his films in conjunction with social activism campaigns that address the controversial issues he confronts in the script. He uses his work to tackle issues before they go mainstream, bringing sensitive debates to a wider audience with close attention to aesthetics, music and innovative marketing. Openly gay and publicly outspoken since the beginning of his career, Romas has been widely recognised as a leading activist for LGBTQ+ equality in his home country Lithuania, an environment with plenty of inspiration for films about in justice.</p>
            <p>Romas studied in Paris 8 University, speaks French and loves French cinema –and he turned out to be an enfant terrible. After a decade of being unsure whether he is more of a filmmaker or an activist, he has now decided to be proud of being both at the same time.</p>
            <p>Romas' short film Porno Melodrama and subsequent features We Will Riot and You Can’t Escape Lithuania tackle the subjects of queer love, resurgent nationalism and politics. The films premiered at the Berlinale in 2011, Moscow International Film Festival in 2013 and New York’s Bushwick Film Festival in 2016 respectively, and have been showing around the world ever since.</p>

            <p>Julie Newmar, began her historic career as one of the brides in the classic MGM musical "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers”. In `Silk Stockings' she won her first Tony for Best Featured Actress at 19 and starred in the hit comedy "Marriage-Go-Round" with Claudette Colbert and Charles Boyer. Her legs were famously insured for $10 million by 20th Century Fox. Making the transition to TV, Julie had many memorable song and dance routines but is best known for her comedic as well as supernatural roles. She was the complex and alluring motorcycle babe in "Route 66”, starred in "Twilight Zone" episodes and as the lead in "My Living Doll" as Rhoda the robot, still a cult sitcom favorite.</p>
            <p>In 1966, urged by her brother at Harvard, she created the role of Catwoman in "Batman." Her sense of humor and physicality made her this show’s most popular villain. She was killed off in "Columbo" but slayed audiences as Lola in "Damn Yankees." In the 1980s, Julie appeared in nine feature films while raising her son. A mother at 49 and divorced, she attended UCLA and took courses so she could more effectively run her own real estate business. In 1991, Julie took on the Rosalind Russel role in "The Women," then astonished Broadway in a revival of "Li’l Abner," 42 years after performing in the original production as Stupefyin’ Jones in the same costume. In her 60s, she became a modeling sensation in Paris for Thierry Mugler and appeared among the fashion world’s most gorgeous divas including in George Michael’s music video "Too Funky."</p>
            <p>Few women have had a movie named after them. Julie’s name literally became box office via "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar," a film from Stephen Spielberg. She also appeared in her own "A&E Biography.”"Beauty is her business" as well as her passion for art and design and gardening, which have led to a rose, day lily, and an orchid named in her honor. Her magnificent sprawling gardens are first choice for L.A.’s top charity events.</p>
