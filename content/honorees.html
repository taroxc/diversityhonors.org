            <p>Julie Newmar, began her historic career as one of the brides in the classic MGM musical "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers”. In `Silk Stockings' she won her first Tony for Best Featured Actress at 19 and starred in the hit comedy "Marriage-Go-Round" with Claudette Colbert and Charles Boyer. Her legs were famously insured for $10 million by 20th Century Fox. Making the transition to TV, Julie had many memorable song and dance routines but is best known for her comedic as well as supernatural roles. She was the complex and alluring motorcycle babe in "Route 66”, starred in "Twilight Zone" episodes and as the lead in "My Living Doll" as Rhoda the robot, still a cult sitcom favorite.</p>
            <p>In 1966, urged by her brother at Harvard, she created the role of Catwoman in "Batman." Her sense of humor and physicality made her this show’s most popular villain. She was killed off in "Columbo" but slayed audiences as Lola in "Damn Yankees." In the 1980s, Julie appeared in nine feature films while raising her son. A mother at 49 and divorced, she attended UCLA and took courses so she could more effectively run her own real estate business. In 1991, Julie took on the Rosalind Russel role in "The Women," then astonished Broadway in a revival of "Li’l Abner," 42 years after performing in the original production as Stupefyin’ Jones in the same costume. In her 60s, she became a modeling sensation in Paris for Thierry Mugler and appeared among the fashion world’s most gorgeous divas including in George Michael’s music video "Too Funky."</p>
            <p>Few women have had a movie named after them. Julie’s name literally became box office via "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar," a film from Stephen Spielberg. She also appeared in her own "A&E Biography.”"Beauty is her business" as well as her passion for art and design and gardening, which have led to a rose, day lily, and an orchid named in her honor. Her magnificent sprawling gardens are first choice for L.A.’s top charity events.</p>
